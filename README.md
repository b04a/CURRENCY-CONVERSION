# CURRENCY-CONVERSION
CURRENCY CONVERSION

This is my first project where I used SwiftUI in verst and designed the project through REST API, thanks to https://apilayer.com/ my proposal works, special thanks to them for providing free rate.

The essence of the project:
User can enter the amount of currency and choose what currency he wrote and then convert it to another currency.

Example on the screenshot. This time I decided to download all the files, so maybe someone will find it useful

P.s. This project does not have any architecture and also it is not optimized by the code, because the main task was to make an application with SwiftUI and REST API.
